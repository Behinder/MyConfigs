In this repo I will include my configuration files for:
vim
== omnicppcomplete
== supertab
== tags for standard c++ library and qt4
== gccsense completion

-2.02.2011 Added vim-addon-manager (only for console vim)

usage:
copy vimwtyczki to your $HOME directory
copy vim-config to ~.vim/
check in .vimrc if you have uncommented sourcing managersettings.vim for vim-addon specific settings.
If something doesn't work comment the file to not load vim-addon plugin.
